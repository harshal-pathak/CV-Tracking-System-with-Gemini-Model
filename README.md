Created an amazing Smart CV Tracking System(CTS),
âœ¨ Key Benefits:
1. Instantly assess how well your resume fits a job.
2. Get actionable insights to tailor your application.
3. Maximize your chances of landing interviews.

To address this, I developed an application from scratch using Google Colab Studio and integrated it with Gemini Pro generative AI, Python, Streamlit, PyPDF2, Python-dotenv.

This Smart CTS app analyzes CV against JD, highlighting missing keywords and assessing the match percentage.
Overall, the future of CTS lies in the continuous evolution and integration of advanced technologies, combined with a steadfast commitment to fairness, transparency, and ethical principles in recruitment processes.
Smart CV Tracking System (CTS) serves as a valuable tool not only for recruiters but also for candidates in self-evaluation. By providing candidates with insights into how well their CV's match job descriptions, CTS empowers them to improve their applications and increase their chances of success. This self-evaluation aspect can be incredibly beneficial for candidates
