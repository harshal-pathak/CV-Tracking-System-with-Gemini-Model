Created an amazing Smart CV Tracking System(CTS),
âœ¨ Key Benefits:
1. Instantly assess how well your resume fits a job.
2. Get actionable insights to tailor your application.
3. Maximize your chances of landing interviews.

To address this, I developed an application from scratch using Google Colab Studio and integrated it with Gemini Pro generative AI, Python, Streamlit, PyPDF2, Python-dotenv.

This Smart CTS app analyzes CV against JD, highlighting missing keywords and assessing the match percentage.
